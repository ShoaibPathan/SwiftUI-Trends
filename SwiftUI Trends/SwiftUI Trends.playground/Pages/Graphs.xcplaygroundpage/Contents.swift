 # Graphs and Charts
 
 Charts are an excellent way to present data to your users. They help users grasp the relationships inherent in large amounts of information. You can use charts to draw attention to trends, clarify causes and assist your users in truly visualizing the information.
 In this SwiftUI tutorial, you’ll learn how to create a variety of custom charts to help visualize your app’s data.
 While SwiftUI doesn’t provide a native chart library, it includes a rich graphics capability you can use to build custom charts. In this chapter, we will learn about the following topics.
 
- How to create custom Data Model ?
- How to fetch the data ?
- Bar graphs
- Line graphs
- Pie Charts
- How to use Capsules ?
- How to add packages and use it ?
- How to create tab bar ?
