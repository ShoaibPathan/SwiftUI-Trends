 # Welcome To SwiftUI Trends Playground
![SwiftUI Trends](swiftui.png "SwiftUI")
 
Hello, my name is Sai Ranga Reddy. I'm 20 years old, and I am from India. I am fascinated by how mobile devices and applications influence our daily lives. I have always had a passion for App Development.

I started my iOS Development 3 months back. In these 3 months, I have learned Swift language and worked with the UIKit framework and SwiftUI framework. I love working with SwiftUI. So, I created this playground to understand the "UI Trends" in SwiftUI.

Most developers across the world told they love SwiftUI because it's easy and uses less code.

 ## Why I have Created this Playground ?
 * * * *
 The design industry has crossed many rivers to become innovative and immersive. While there are some brands like Uber with its design guideline or MailChimp who have understood and went with the flow, there are brands that are still not giving app design its fair share of attention.
 
 The abbreviation UI stands for User Interface. It is the way through which users can interact with any mobile apps. Mobile app user interface design is aimed towards easy, enjoyable and effective interactions between users and the app. UI in IT is any device that allows users to interact with monitors, screens or mobile devices. The primary goal of mobile app UI principles is to provide the best interaction possible.
 
 Apple Introduced SwiftUI to make UI more attractive and effective, with this framework we can create Classic Works. All I wanna say is UI is plays one of the key role in App Development. In this playground you will learn some best things in SwiftUI.

 ## New to SwiftUI
 * * * *
 In case you are a newbie,  SwiftUI was introduced in WWDC19. It is a user interface toolkit that lets us design apps in a declarative way. That’s a fancy way of saying that we tell SwiftUI how we want our UI to look and work, and it figures out how to make that happen as the user interacts with it.
 
 Declarative UI is best understood in comparison to imperative UI, which is what iOS developers were doing before iOS 13. In an imperative user interface, we might make a function be called when a button was clicked, and inside the function, we’d read a value and show a label – we regularly modify the way the user interface looks and works based on what’s happening.

 Before Starting the Playground, its good to have knowledge about Stacks in SwiftUI. If not remember it like this
 - HStack: ![Horizontally Aligned](),
 - VStack: ![Vertically Aligned](),
 - ZStacks: ![Aglined on top of each other(Z-axis)]()
