/*
 What is Identifiable Protocol ?
 
 This is one of the protocols built into Swift, and means ‚Äúthis type can be identified uniquely.‚Äù It has only one requirement, which is that there must be a property called id that contains a unique identifier. We just added that, so we don‚Äôt need to do any extra work ‚Äì our type conforms to Identifiable just fine.

Now, you might wonder why we added that, because our code was working fine before. Well, because our expense items are now guaranteed to be identifiable uniquely, we no longer need to tell ForEach which property to use for the identifier ‚Äì it knows there will be an id property and that it will be unique, because that‚Äôs the point of the Identifiable protocol.
 
 What is UUID() ?
 
 UUID ‚Äì short for ‚Äúuniversally unique identifier‚Äù, and if that doesn‚Äôt sound unique I‚Äôm not sure what does.

 UUIDs are long hexadecimal strings such as this one: 08B15DB4-2F02-4AB8-A965-67A9C90D8A44. So, that‚Äôs eight digits, four digits, four digits, four digits, then twelve digits, of which the only requirement is that there‚Äôs a 4 in the first number of the third block. If we subtract the fixed 4, we end up with 31 digits, each of which can be one of 16 values ‚Äì if we generated 1 UUID every second for a billion years, we might begin to have the slightest chance of generating a duplicate.
